            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Rahul, a dedicated and ambitious individual currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications
                (MCA) at St. Joseph College of Engineering. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA)
                from SDM College of Business Management. I come from a supportive family of four, including my father,
                mother, and brother.

                With a strong foundation in computer science, my short-term goal is to secure a challenging position
                that allows me to apply my skills and knowledge effectively. Looking ahead, I am determined to achieve
                great heights in my career, contributing meaningfully to whichever field I choose to excel in.

                Beyond academics and career aspirations, I am passionate about watching movies and listening to music,
                activities that fuel my creativity and keep me balanced.
